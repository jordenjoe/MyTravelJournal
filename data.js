We did a GoT tour of 'King's Landing'! Learning about the history and recovery of Dubrovnik after the war damage in the 1990s  was interesting and makes Dubrovnik a great spot for anyone interested in history. We also kayaked, hit the beaches, and walked the walls.",

We had so much fun hiking, putting our tiny Kia rental car through treacherous roads, and riding icelandic horses. Although we got lost on a hike and ended up wandering through ranches for a couple hours, it was a fabulous trip. Fun fact: the sun hardly sets in Croatia in the summer. ",

We rented special gear to make it easier to walk through the water. Some parts were so deep that I went swimming - the water is freezing cold. Fun fact: the Zion Canyon was carved over millions of years by the Virgin River and is approximately 2k feet deep.",
